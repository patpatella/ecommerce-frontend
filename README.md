ECOMMERCE (frontend)

# Tech stack:
* React, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS (or custom CSS).

# How to run:

npm install → npm run dev
* Open the browser at the displayed local URL (eg. http://localhost:5173) to see the app.

# Layout approach: 
* The frontend uses a flexible grid and card-based layout to display products, combined with a sticky, modern header and a scrollable cart drawer for intuitive navigation.

# Responsiveness considerations: 
* Responsiveness is achieved with CSS grid auto-fit and media queries, ensuring content adapts seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
